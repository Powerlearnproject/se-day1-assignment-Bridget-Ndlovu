#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process or procedure of designing, developing and maintaining software and plays a role in the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestones in the evolution of Software Engineering are 
Change analysis, release planning, system implementation, and releasing a system to customers
 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Explanations of the Software Development Life Cycle:
1.Requirements- Gathering  and documenting user needs and system requirements
2.Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3.Implementaion- Writing code and building the software according to design specifications
4.Testing- Conductiong various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements
5.Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers
6.Maintenance- Providing ongoing support , updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- The sequeantial approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall
example: requirements, design and implementation

Agile methodolgy- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change 
Example: flexibility and collaboration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The roles and responsibilities of a:
Software Developer- Is responsible for writing code and implementing software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executiing test plans
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The immportance if Intergrated Development Enviroments (IDEs) in the Software Developement process:
provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code. 
Examples:
Visual Studio (which is the on eI'm familiar with) and Eclipse

The importance of Version Control Systems (VSC) in the Software Development process:
Provides software tools for tracking changes to source code and co-ordinating work among team members.
Examples:
Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by Software Engineers are:
1.Having to meet tight deaslines and the pressure that comes with it.
2.Technical debt which can affect future development efforts and increase maintenace costs.
3.Challenging requirements which may change during the development cycle which later leads to project delays.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Explanations of the different types of testing:
Unit testing- This is to test the individual components or modules of softwares.
Intergration testing- This is to test the interactions between components or subsystems
System testing- This is to test the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- This is to test the software against user requirements to ensure or make sure that the user's needs are met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the key to create or craft questions or statements to ge the best and accurate responses from AI models. "And more like giving precise instructions to a very smart assistant"

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about cars" and to improve it by making it clear, specific and concise would be "Tell me about the Mercedes latest cars"
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and precise. It is straight to the point.
